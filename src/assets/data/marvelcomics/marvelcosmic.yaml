    comment: "Thanos, Drax, Silver Surfer, Captain Marvel, Adam Warlock. This era introduces many of the main cosmic characters.
      The main storyline is mostly written by Jim Starlin and climax with the Infinity Gauntlet story arc but still continues for many years.
      Side stories includes the origins of the Silver Surfer, the adventures of the original Guardians of the Galaxy in the future, the life of Quasar and the Avengers at war with the Krees, the Skrulls and the Shi'ar."

            comment: After issue 122, the story of the surfer continues in Silver Surfer (1987) 123-146 where he discovers the truth beind the illusion of Zenn-La. Those issues are not listed here as they are not cosmic in nature.

Issue 25 cannot really be considerd canon but it introduces the romance between Phyla and Moon-Dragon that will be a thing for years to come. Ends with the death of Genis-Vell in 2 issues of Thunderbolts.

            comment: "Jim Starlin continues the story of Thanos and Adam Warlock that he started way back in the 70's. It seems that this story starts after the Infinity crossover event and end after Secret Wars. It's hard to place it in a timeline as there are quiet a lot of continuity errors, I would advice to take it on its own and maybe even to place it on a parallel universe."
